<h2>React authentication app</h2>

1. Clone project
2. Open terminal
3. enter this command: npm install
4. Create a .env file
5. Add this to the .env : REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or the url of the laravel app in the .env file)
6. now in termina enter : npm start

<p> Note: Without the backend this app will not work. so make sure to run the backend before testing this project</p>

<p> Normally in a production grade project I wouldn't follow this approch for authentication , We have Next js and NextAuth for as a better approcah.
